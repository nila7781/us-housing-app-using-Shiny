# Interactive Housing Data Web App

Welcome to the Interactive Housing Data Web App project! This application, built using Shiny for Python, showcases real housing data through interactive visualizations. The app provides features such as dynamic charts and graphs, user-friendly data filtering, real-time updates, and detailed analysis tools to explore housing market trends. To run the project locally, clone the repository, create and activate a virtual environment, install the required packages, and run the application using `shiny run app.py`. Navigate to `https://housingappofnilanjan.shinyapps.io/webapp_shiny/` in your web browser to start using the app. Ensure you have the appropriate data file with relevant attributes like price, location, and size. Contributions to enhance the app are welcome; simply fork the repository, create a new branch, commit your changes, push to the branch, and open a pull request.
